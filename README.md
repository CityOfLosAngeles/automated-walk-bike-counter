# Great Streets + et al - Counterbot 

## About

The City currently does bicycle and pedestrian counts via having a person manually the number of cyclists and pedestrians that go through an intersection via a video capture. 

However, thanks to advances in Machine Vision technology, we could now automate that, allowing us to constantly count the number of pedestrians and cyclists, rather than only doing a 24 hour sample. 

This project is a proof of concept of how we could count the number folks moving through our streets.

## Goals

Long term, allow us to know annual active transportation counts for key corridors. 

## Deliverables

Using the Google Machine Vision API, take data from video feeds and produce bicycle and pedestrian counts in the same format we got before. 

## Data Sources

* Video Data (
* Count Ouput data (see `data` directory)
